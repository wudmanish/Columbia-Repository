	Modify sorting algorithms to count number of operations
	Consider which is the best case and which is the worst case for each algorithm and compare number of operations
	Try and find a way to graph your findings (size of input, number of operations)
	Figure out how to connect to the intert with your VM (if not already connected)
	Sign up for github.com and try to understand the basic commands(int, status, add, commit, push, pull)
